INTRODUCTION							*wheel-introduction*

Wheel is a plugin for vim or neovim aimed at managing buffer groups.

In short, this plugin let you organize your buffers by creating as
many buffer groups as you need, add the buffers you want to it and
quickly navigate between :

- Buffers of the same group
- Buffer groups

Note that :

- A location contains a name, a filename, as well as a line & column number
- A buffer group, in fact a location group, is called a circle
- A set of buffer groups is called a torus (a circle of circles)
- The list of toruses is called the wheel

## Why do you need three levels of grouping ?

At first glance, managing groups with circles in a torus seems to
be sufficient. But with time, the torus grows big, and a third level
helps you to organize your files by groups and categories:

  - The wheel contains all the toruses
  - Each torus contains a category of files, e.g.:
    + configuration, development, publication
  - Each circle contains a project, e.g.:
    + emacs or vifm circles in configuration torus
    + shell or elisp in development torus
    + tea or art in publication torus

GOAL									*wheel-goal*

Torus helps you to organize your files in groups that you create
yourself, following your workflow. You only add the files you want,
where you want. For instance, if you have a "organize" group with
agenda & todo files, you can quickly alternate them, or display them
in two windows. Then, if you suddenly got an idea to tune emacs, you
switch to the "emacs" group with your favorites configuration files in
it. Same process, to cycle, alternate or display the files. Note that
the toruses containing all these groups can be saved on a file and
loaded later. Over time, your groups will grow and adapt to your
style.
